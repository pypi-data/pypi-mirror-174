## Installation

To install python-amcards, simply run this command in your terminal:

```
$ pip install python-amcards
```

## Usage

All interactions with the AMcards API are made through the AMcardsClient class.

First, create an AMcardsClient as follows:

```
>>> from amcards import AMcardsClient
>>> client = AMcardsClient('youraccesstoken')
```

Here `'youraccesstoken'` will be replaced with a string containing your AMcards access token. You can generate one [here](https://amcards.com/user/connected-applications/).
