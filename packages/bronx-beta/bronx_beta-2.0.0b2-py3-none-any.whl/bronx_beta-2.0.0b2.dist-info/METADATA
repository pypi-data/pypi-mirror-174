*bronx* stands for "Bunch of Reusable Objects Not in vorteX". It is a collection
of basic utilities that can be used in various projects.

Originally, it has been developed as part of the *Vortex* project. Recently
the  code has been extracted from the *Vortex* code base. It is now presented
as an independent Python package.

WARNING: This is a test repository (for demo purposes). At some point, it will
be deleted (and replaced by another one; at a more suitable location).
