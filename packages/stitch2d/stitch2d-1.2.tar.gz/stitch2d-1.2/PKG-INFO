Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

stitch2D is a Python script that stitches a two-dimensional grid of tiles into a mosaic. It was originally developed for stitching together images collected on various microscopes in the Department of Mineral Sciences at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.

 Install with:

```
pip install stitch2d
```

 When tiles are stitched together by stitch2d, they are translated, not rotated, resized, or warped. As a result, stitch2d requires all images to be the same size and orientation. Images must overlap, although they don't necessarily need to be arranged in a grid.
