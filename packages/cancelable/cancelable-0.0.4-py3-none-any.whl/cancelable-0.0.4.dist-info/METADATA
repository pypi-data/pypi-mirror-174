# Installation
```
pip install cancelable
```

# Usage
Without the normal time package:
## Sleep
```python
from cancelable import time
import threading

def count():
  i = 1
  while True:
    time.sleep(1)
    print(i)
    i += 1

threading._start_new_thread(count, ())

input("Click enter to cancel counting\n")

time.cancel()
```
With the normal time package:
```python
from cancelable import time as cancelableTime
import threading

def count():
  i = 1
  while True:
    cancelableTime.sleep(1)
    print(i)
    i += 1

threading._start_new_thread(count, ())

input("Click enter to cancel counting\n")

cancelableTime.cancel()
```

## Input
```python
from cancelable import time, input, cancelInput
import threading

name = ""
def ask():
  global name
  name = input("Your name: ")
  time.cancel()

threading._start_new_thread(ask, ())

time.sleep(5)
cancelInput()

print(name)
```

# To do
Add more functions such as input()
