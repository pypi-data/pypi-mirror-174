This is a non-exhaustive list of related, open-source projects for analysis of
EBSD data that users of kikuchipy might find useful:

- :doc:`HyperSpy <hyperspy:index>`: Python library with tools for multi-dimensional data
  analysis, which kikuchipy builds upon.
- `EMsoft <https://github.com/EMsoft-org/EMsoft>`__: Series of Fortran programs which,
  among numerous other tasks, can dynamically simulate EBSD, Electron Channeling Pattern
  (ECP) and Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD) master patterns.

  data.
  kikuchipy depends on orix for all operations with vectors, rotations and crystal
  symmetry.
