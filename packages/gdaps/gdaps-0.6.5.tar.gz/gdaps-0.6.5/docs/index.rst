GDAPS - Generic Django Apps Plugin System
=========================================

Welcome to the GDAPS documentation!

GDAPS is a plugin system that can be added to Django, **to create applications that can be extended via plugins later**.

.. warning::
    As I completely abandoned Vue, Svelte, and other Javascript frontend frameworks in favour of other frameworks like `Tetra <https://tetraframework.com>`_ (or `Unicorn <https://django-unicorn.com>`_, `Turbo-Django <https://turbo-django.readthedocs.io>`_ etc.), **gdaps-frontend support for Vue is deprecated and will be dropped in near future**.

I'd like to give back what I received from many Open Source software packages, and keep this
library as open as possible, and it should stay this way.
