`pyoutbreaksnearme` is a Python3, asyncio-based library for getting data from
[Outbreaks Near Me](https://outbreaksnearme.org).

# Installation

```bash
pip install pyoutbreaksnearme
```

# Python Versions

`pyoutbreaksnearme` is currently supported on:

- Python 3.9
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11

# Usage

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pyoutbreaksnearme import Client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    client = await Client()

    # Get user-reported data for the location closest to a latitude/longitude:
    nearest_user_data = await client.user_data.async_get_nearest_by_coordinates(
        40.7152, -73.9877
    )

    # Get totals for user-reported data:
    user_totals_data = await client.user_data.async_get_totals()

    # Get CDC data for the location closest to a latitude/longitude:
    nearest_user_data = await client.cdc_data.async_get_nearest_by_coordinates(
        40.7152, -73.9877
    )


asyncio.run(main())
```

By default, the library creates a new connection to Outbreaks Near Me with each
coroutine. If you are calling a large number of coroutines (or merely want to squeeze
out every second of runtime savings possible), an
[`aiohttp`](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) `ClientSession` can be used for connection
pooling:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pyoutbreaksnearme import Client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        # Create a Notion API client:
        client = await Client(session=session)

        # Get to work...


asyncio.run(main())
```
