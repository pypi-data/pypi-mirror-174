    # JSON, CSV, or TXT. Use ALL to output to all types

    # Test suites group both standalone tests and test classes together

    # You can also the regex argument on test suites and test classes to specify specific tests to run.
    # The regex uses the re.match function

    # Now to run the code!!!
    # See how the output of running the run() function or calling write() looks. Also check out the new TXT and CSV files.
