# Matrices-Py

Dynamic, vectorized sequence types in ≤ 2 dimensions.

This library aims to be a "natural" extension to the core Python tool set - similar to the [`fractions`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html) module of the standard library, but centered around matrices. Everything contained within this library is, and will always be, written in Python alone.

The intent, here, is **not** to provide a substitute for [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). While there may be similarities in certain parts of the API, NumPy should always be the choice for efficient data storage and vectorization in larger applications - especially in more than two dimensions.

## Getting Started

This project is available through [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (requires Python 3.10 or higher, 3.11 is recommended):

```
pip install matrices-py
```

Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/braedynl/matrices-py/wiki), along with some examples and recipes.

**Note that this library is in its infancy, and may see future changes that are not always backwards compatible.**
