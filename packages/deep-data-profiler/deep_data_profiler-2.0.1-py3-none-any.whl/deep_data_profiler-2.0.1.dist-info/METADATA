The Deep Data Profiling (DDP) library provides tools for analyzing the internal decision structure of a trained deep neural network.
The library was inspired by the work of Qiu, et al. in Adversarial Defense Through
Network Profiling Based Path Extraction (2019), arXiv:1904.08089.
Full documentation may be found at [https://pnnl.github.io/DeepDataProfiler](https://pnnl.github.io/DeepDataProfiler).

DDP contains code for generating graphical representations and feature visualizations,
for VGG-like sequential and ResNet models implemented in PyTorch.
DDP also provides tools from topological data analysis for analysis of these representations.
