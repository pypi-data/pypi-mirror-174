            Required unless ``target`` is specified.
        instruction_durations (Optional[InstructionDurations]): Durations for gates
            in the target's basis. Must include durations for all gates
            that appear in input DAGs other than ``swap`` (for which
            durations are calculated through decomposition if not supplied).
            Required unless ``target`` is specified.
        basis_gates (Optional[List[str]]): The list of basis gates for the
            target. Required unless ``instruction_durations``
            contains durations for all swap gates or ``target`` is specified.
        backend_properties (Optional[BackendProperties]): The backend

            or ``target`` is specified.
        target (Optional[Target]): The backend transpiler target. If specified,

            and ``backend_properties``. All gates that appear in input DAG other
            than ``swap`` must be supported by the target and have duration
            information available therein.
        normalize_scale (int): Multiple by this factor when converting

            where min_duration is the length of the fastest non-zero duration
