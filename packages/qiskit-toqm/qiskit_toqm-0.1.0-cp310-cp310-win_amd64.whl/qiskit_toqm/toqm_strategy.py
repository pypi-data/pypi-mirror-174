        Constructs a TOQM strategy that aims to minimize overall circuit duration.
        The priority queue used in the A* is configured to drop the worst nodes
        whenever it reaches the queue size limit. Node expansion is also limited
        to exploring the best ``K`` children.

        Args:
            latency_descriptions (List[toqm.LatencyDescription]): The latency descriptions
            for all gates that will appear in the circuit, including swaps.
            top_k (int): The maximum number of best child nodes that can be pushed to the
            queue during expansion of any given node.
            queue_target (int): When the priority queue reaches capacity, nodes are dropped
            until the size reaches this value.
            queue_max (int): The priority queue capacity.
            retain_popped (int): Final nodes to retain.
