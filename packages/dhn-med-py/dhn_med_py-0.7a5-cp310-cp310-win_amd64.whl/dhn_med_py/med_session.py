    Basic object for reading operations with MED sessions.
    
    The constructor opens the MED session (reads basic metadata and opens data files
    for reading).
    
    The destructor closes open files and frees allocated memory.

    Constructor Parameters
    ----------
    session_path: str
        path to MED session
    password: str (default=None)
        password for MED session
    reference_channel (default=first channel in the session, in alphanumeric ordering)
        since different channels can have different sampling frequencies,
        select a particular channel to be used when indexing by sample sample number.

        Positive times are considered to be absolute, and negative times are considered to be relative.
        
        Examples of relative times:

        the first channel (in alphanumeric channel name).  A reference channel is necessary
