# Maxwell üëπ

Maxwell is a Python library for learning the stochastic edit distance (SED)
between source and target alphabets for string transduction. 

Given a corpus of source and target string pairs, it uses expectation-maximization 
to learn the log-probability weights of edit actions (copy, substitution, deletion, insertion)
that minimize the number of edits between source and target strings. These weights
can then be used for edits over unknown strings through Viterbi decoding.

## Install

First install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then install:

    python setup.py install

Or:

    python setup.py develop

The latter creates a Python module in your environment that updates as you
update the code. It can then be imported like a regular Python module:

```python
import maxwell
```

## Usage

SED training can be done as either a command line tool or imported as a
Python dependency. 

For command-line use, run:

```bash
maxwell-train --train-data-path /path/to/train/data --output-path /path/to/output/file --num-epoch NUM_TRAINING_EPOCHS
```

As a library object, you can use the `StochasticEditDistance` class to pass any iterable
of source-target pairs for training. Learned edit weights can then be saved with the
`write_params` method.

```python
from maxwell.sed import StochasticEditDistance

aligner = StochasticEditDistance.fit_from_data(training_samples, NUM_TRAINING_EPOCHS)
aligner.params.write_params(/path/to/output/file)
```

After training, parameters can be loaded from file to calculate optimal edits between
strings with the `action_sequence` method, which returns a tuple of the learned optimal
sequence and the weight given to the sequence:

```python
from maxwell.sed import StochasticEditDistance, params

sed_align_params = params.read_params(/path/to/learned/parameters/)
aligner = StochasticEditDistance(sed_align_params)
	
optimal_sequence, optimal_cost = aligner.action_sequence(source, target)
```

If only weight and no actions are required, `action_sequence_cost` can be called instead

```python
optimal_cost = aligner.action_sequence_cost(source, target)
```

Conversely, individual actions can be evaluated with the `action_cost` method:

```python
action_cost = aligner.action_cost(action)
```

## Details

### Data

The default data format is based on the SIGMORPHON 2017 shared tasks:

    source   target    ...

That is, the first column is the source (a lemma) and the second is the target.

In the case where the formatting is different, the `--source-col` and `--target-col`
flags can be invoked. For instance, for the SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task data format:

    source   ...    target

### Edit Actions

Edit weights are maintained as a `ParamsDict` object, a dataclass comprising three dictionaries
and one floats. The dictionaries, and their indexing, are as follows:

1. `delta_sub`
        Keys: Tuple of source alphabet X target alphabet. 
		Values: Substitution weight for all non-equivalent source-target pairs.
		        If source symbol == target symbol, a seperate copy probability is used.
2. `delta_del`
        Keys: All symbols in source string alphabet. Represents deletion from string.
		Values: Deletion weight for removal of source symbol from string.
2. `delta_ins`
        Keys: All symbols in target string alphabet. Represents insertion into string.
		Values: Insertion weight for introduction of target symbol into string.
2. `delta_eos`
        Special float value representing probability of terminating the string.

In Python, these values may be accessed through a `StochasticEditDistance` object through the `params` attribute.
