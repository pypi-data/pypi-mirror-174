### Description
Perock is Python brute-force attack library built on threads and asyncio. Its
intended for simplifying brute-force attack by performing common tasks in
brute-force such as calculating cartesian product.

Perock was built to be general purpose in that it can be used for wide 
variety of brute-force attack activities. It can be used with html forms,
file with passwords, API requiring username and password, etc.

Perock is currently undergoing major changes as mentioned 
in issue [#44](https://github.com/sekgobela-kevin/perock/issues/44).
