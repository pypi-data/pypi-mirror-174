"""Unit Testing

This modules includes, a test runner, test suites,
test classes, test cases(functions), asserts, mocks, and much more.

Below are a few generic levels of testing which can be mixed together however you want.

1. Use the provided `runTest` function to run a single method with the `@test` decorator
    ```python
    from teddecor.UnitTest import *
    
    @test
    def test_case():
        assert True

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        runTest(test_case)
    ```

2. Use the provided `Test` class to group test cases (functions) with the `@test` decorator.
   * This meant to group test that are focuses on a specific functionality
    ```python
    from teddecor.UnitTest import *
    
    class TestClass(Test):
        @test
        def test_case(self):
            assert True

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        TestClass().run()
    ```

3. Use the provided `TestSuite` class to group test classes and test cases together
   * This is meant to group a more general idea. Like the tests for a app can be split into backend and front end. Where both backend and frontend are their own test suite. Then inside the suites you get more focuses.
    ```python
    from teddecor.UnitTest import *
    
    class BackendInput(Test):
        @test
        def user_input(self):
            assert True
        
        @test
        def file_input(self):
            assert True

    @test
    def app_response():
        raise NotImplementedError

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        TestSuite(
            name="Backend"
            tests=[
                BackendInput,
                app_response,
            ]
        ).run()
    ```

   *  As you can see in the above example, you can use `raise NotImplementedError` to skip a test which also gives the message of `Not Implemented`

4. Use provided `Asserts` and `AssertThat` modules to add readable, easy to use, testing assertions.
   ```python
    from teddecor.UnitTest import *

    @test
    def assert_that():
        assertThat(12, eq(12))
        # Reads as, assert that 12 is equal to 12
        assertThat("the", within(["the", "moon"]))
        # Reads as, assert that "the" is within ["the", "moon"]
        assertThat("the moon", has("moon"))
        # Reads as, assert that "the moon" has "moon"

    @test
    def base_asserts():
        Asserts.assert_equals(12, 12)
   ```
   * Read the documentation for the `Asserts` and `AssertThat` modules for more information along with how you can create your own functions for assertThat
   
Below is an example test (`example.py`)

```python
from teddecor.UnitTest import *

class Example(Test):
  @test
  def test_pass(self):
    assert True

if __name__ == "__main__":
  Example().main()
```

The above example shows that you need to have a class that inherits from `UnitTest.Test`. Then when you run the `main()` function from an instance of that class,
you get the results printed out. The `main()` function will run any method in the class that has the `@test` decorator.
