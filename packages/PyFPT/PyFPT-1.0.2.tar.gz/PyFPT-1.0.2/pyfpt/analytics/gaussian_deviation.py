Gaussian Deviation
------------------
This module calculates the point of deviation from Gaussian behaviour for the
first-passage times in the number of e-folds for a provided threshold value
using the `Edgeworth series`_ in low diffusion limit
and the relations for the central moments given in `Vennin--Starobinsky 2015`_.
This is calculated by using root finding to find the point at which the higher
order terms of the Edgeworth series first equal the threshold.
