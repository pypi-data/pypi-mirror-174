[Amazon GameLift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-intro.html) is a service used
to deploy, operate, and scale dedicated, low-cost servers in the cloud for session-based multiplayer games. Built
on AWS global computing infrastructure, GameLift helps deliver high-performance, high-reliability game servers
while dynamically scaling your resource usage to meet worldwide player demand.

GameLift is composed of three main components:

* GameLift FlexMatch which is a customizable matchmaking service for
  multiplayer games. With FlexMatch, you can
  build a custom set of rules that defines what a multiplayer match looks like
  for your game, and determines how to
  evaluate and select compatible players for each match. You can also customize
  key aspects of the matchmaking
  process to fit your game, including fine-tuning the matching algorithm.
* GameLift hosting for custom or realtime servers which helps you deploy,
  operate, and scale dedicated game servers. It regulates the resources needed to
  host games, finds available game servers to host new game sessions, and puts
  players into games.
* GameLift FleetIQ to optimize the use of low-cost Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
  (Amazon EC2) Spot Instances for cloud-based game hosting. With GameLift
  FleetIQ, you can work directly with your hosting resources in Amazon EC2 and
  Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling while taking advantage of GameLift optimizations to
  deliver inexpensive, resilient game hosting for your players

This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project. It allows you to define components for your matchmaking
configuration or game server fleet management system.

## GameLift Hosting

### Defining a GameLift Fleet

GameLift helps you deploy, operate, and scale dedicated game servers for
session-based multiplayer games. It helps you regulate the resources needed to
host your games, finds available game servers to host new game sessions, and
puts players into games.

### Uploading builds and scripts to GameLift

Before deploying your GameLift-enabled multiplayer game servers for hosting with the GameLift service, you need to upload
your game server files. This section provides guidance on preparing and uploading custom game server build
files or Realtime Servers server script files. When you upload files, you create a GameLift build or script resource, which
you then deploy on fleets of hosting resources.

To troubleshoot fleet activation problems related to the server script, see [Debug GameLift fleet issues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creating-debug.html).

#### Upload a custom server build to GameLift

Before uploading your configured game server to GameLift for hosting, package the game build files into a build directory.
This directory must include all components required to run your game servers and host game sessions, including the following:

* Game server binaries – The binary files required to run the game server. A build can include binaries for multiple game
  servers built to run on the same platform. For a list of supported platforms, see [Download Amazon GameLift SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-supported.html).
* Dependencies – Any dependent files that your game server executables require to run. Examples include assets, configuration
  files, and dependent libraries.
* Install script – A script file to handle tasks that are required to fully install your game build on GameLift hosting
  servers. Place this file at the root of the build directory. GameLift runs the install script as part of fleet creation.

You can set up any application in your build, including your install script, to access your resources securely on other AWS
services.

```python
# bucket: s3.Bucket

gamelift.Build(self, "Build",
    content=gamelift.Content.from_bucket(bucket, "sample-asset-key")
)
```

#### Upload a realtime server Script

Your server script can include one or more files combined into a single .zip file for uploading. The .zip file must contain
all files that your script needs to run.

You can store your zipped script files in either a local file directory or in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
bucket or defines a directory asset which is archived as a .zip file and uploaded to S3 during deployment.

After you create the script resource, GameLift deploys the script with a new Realtime Servers fleet. GameLift installs your
server script onto each instance in the fleet, placing the script files in `/local/game`.

```python
# bucket: s3.Bucket

gamelift.Script(self, "Script",
    content=gamelift.Content.from_bucket(bucket, "sample-asset-key")
)
```
