TorchDynamo is a Python-level JIT compiler designed to make unmodified
PyTorch programs faster. TorchDynamo hooks into the frame evaluation API
in CPython (PEP 523) to dynamically modify Python bytecode right before
it is executed. It rewrites Python bytecode in order to extract sequences
of PyTorch operations into an FX Graph which is then just-in-time
compiled with an ensemble of different backends and autotuning.
