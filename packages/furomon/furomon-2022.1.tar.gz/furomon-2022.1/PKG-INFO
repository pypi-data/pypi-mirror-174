`Forever Scalable`

**Furomon** is a clean customisable Sphinx documentation theme based on Furo by Pradyun Gedam.

Furomon, the mount Furo, a Chakma word which means the mountain which pierced through Earth. It teaches us to be firm and determined against all odds.

## Features


- **Intentionally minimal** --- the most important thing is the content, not the scaffolding around it.
- **Responsive** --- adapting perfectly to the available screen space, to work on all sorts of devices.
- **Customisable** --- change the color palette, font families, logo and more!
- **Easy to navigate** --- with carefully-designed sidebar navigation and inter-page links.
- **Good looking content** --- through clear typography and well-stylised elements.
- **Good looking search** --- helps readers find what they want quickly.
- **Biased for smaller docsets** --- intended for smaller documentation sets, where presenting the entire hierarchy in the sidebar is not overwhelming.


## Quickstart


Furomon is distributed on [PyPI]. To use the theme in your Sphinx project:

1. Install Furomon in documentation's build environment.

   ```text
   pip install furomon
   ```

2. Update the `html_theme` in `conf.py`.

   ```py
   html_theme = "furomon"
   ```

3. Your Sphinx documentation's HTML pages will now be generated with this theme! 🎉
