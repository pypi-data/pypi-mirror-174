  """Computes the one-sided T-test score.

  It scores the confidence that the mean of 'baseline_simple_regrets' is less
  than the mean of 'candidate_simple_regrets'. The lower the score the higher
  the confidence that it's the case.

  One-sample
  ----------
  The test assumes t-distribution with mean given by 'candidate' and compute
  the probability of observing sample mean of 'baseline' or less.

  Two-sample
  ----------
  The test assumes 'baseline' and 'candidate' have the same mean and computes
  the probability that the 'baseline' sample mean is less than the 'candidate'
  sample mean.

  The lower the T-test p-value score the more confidence we have that
  'candidate' is indeed "better" than 'baseline'.

  Arguments:
    baseline_simple_regrets: list of baseline simple regret values.
    candidate_simple_regrets: list of candidate simple regret values.

  Returns:
    The p-value score of the one-sided T test.
