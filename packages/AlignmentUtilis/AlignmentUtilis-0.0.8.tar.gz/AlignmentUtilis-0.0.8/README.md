# AlignmentUtilis

`AlignmentUtilis` is a collection utilities of sequence alignment algorithms,

- Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Watermen algorithms to conduct sequence alignment with affine gap penalty
- Naive exact matching to conduct reads alignment problem
- ...

## How to get it?

```shell
pip install AlignmentUtilis
```



## How to use it?

```shell
# 1. PairwiseSequenceAlignment
from AlignmentUtilis.Pairwise import *
# Test
seq1 = "TCGTAGACGA"
seq2 = "ATAGAATGCGG"
# Run Global Alignment
PairwiseSequenceAlignment.Runalignment(seq1, seq2, 1, -1, -2, -1, local=False)
# Run Local Alignment
PairwiseSequenceAlignment.Runalignment(seq1, seq2, 1, -1, -2, -1, local=True)

# 2. Naive exact matching
from AlignmentUtilis.Naive import *
# Naive Exact Macthing Basic Utility Test
test_occurrences = Naive.naive_exact_matching('AG', 'AGCTTAGATAGC')
print('The pattern is AG')
print('The target sequence is AGCTTAGATAGC')
print(f'The start position of exact matching is {test_occurrences}')

# 3. Booyer-Moore algorithm to reduce the unnecessary alignments
from AlignmentUtilis.BM import *
# BoyerMoore Test
p = 'TCAA'
p_bm = BoyerMoore(p)
print(p_bm.amap)
print(p_bm.bad_character_rule(2, 'T'))

# boyer_moore Test
t = 'ACGTCGTGCGGTGAGTCGGTAGCGTAGCTAGATACAATCAAGAGAGAGTGCGGAGTGCGAGTCAA'
occurrences = boyer_moore(p, p_bm, t)
print(occurrences)
```
