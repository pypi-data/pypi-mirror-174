# Tf2-Keras-Surgeon
Note: This is a modification of keras-Surgeon: https://github.com/BenWhetton/keras-surgeon and 
https://github.com/Raukk/tf-keras-surgeon/ thats been adopted for specific use. If you are interested try adopting the
original keras-surgeon first, to see if it works for you.
This version specifically changes some of the issues with instalation of keras-surgeon, but also has less features,
and is in general not well tested. For additional information, please look at the repositories above.
