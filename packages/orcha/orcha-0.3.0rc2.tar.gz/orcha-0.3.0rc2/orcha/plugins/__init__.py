The plugins are part of the basic structure of Orcha. Plugins allow extended
functionality by using command line arguments and custom
:class:`managers <orcha.lib.Manager>` and :class:`petitions <orcha.interfaces.Petition>`.

Note:
    By default, Orcha provides the complete structure for running and orchestrate
    what you want, based on :attr:`actions <orcha.interfaces.Petition.action>` and
    :attr:`conditions <orcha.interfaces.Petition.conditions>`. Nevertheless, there
    is no code in there and the provided command line interface is just the
    skeleton for further plugins to add their functionality.

    That said, plugins are **mandatory** in order to work with Orcha.
