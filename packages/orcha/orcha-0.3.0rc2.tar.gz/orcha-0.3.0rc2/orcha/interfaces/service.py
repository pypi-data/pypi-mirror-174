    Simple :py:func:`dataclass <dataclasses.dataclass>` which contains the required parameters

    is started and attached to the current session. If given, then a daemon is started with
    the required parameters.

        You can use the :func:`register_service` for defining an instance of this class
        easily and guided, for a background service running as a daemon. If you want a
