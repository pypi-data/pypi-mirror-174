Modules used alongside Orcha environment. This package contains the core of the
orchestrator itself, exposing two main classes:

  + :class:`Manager`, for handling requests and petitions.
  + :class:`Processor`, which receives requests and manages executions.

A plugin/package must inherit from :class:`Manager` and define its own behavior
either as a server or as a client. Further details are exposed in there.

:class:`Processor` is automatically defined based on the expected behavior of
:class:`Manager`, so there is no need to inherit from that class.

Note:
    :class:`Processor` is a singleton, which means that **only exists an instance**.
    This way, you can call the constructor after initialized as much as you want
    that you will get always the same object. This helps to handle the messages,
    signals and other petitions globally on the system without any collision in
    between them
