class Manager(Pluggable):
    """:class:`Manager` is the object an application must inherit from in order to work with
    Orcha. A :class:`Manager` encapsulates all the logic behind the application, making
    easier to handle all incoming petitions and requests.

    The expected workflow for a class inheriting from :class:`Manager` is::

    This means that your class must override :func:`setup` with your own implementation as
    well as :func:`on_start` and :func:`on_finish`. In addition, there is another method
    :func:`convert_to_petition` that your server must implement, which allows passing from
    a :class:`Message` object to a :class:`Petition` one (this method call is used by
    :class:`Processor`).

    Note:
        The :class:`Manager` is an abstract class and the methods above are abstract also,
        which means that you are forced to implement them. On your client managers, you
        can opt in for raising an exception on :func:`on_start`, :func:`on_finish` and
        :func:`convert_to_petition`, as they will never (*should*) be called::

            from orcha.lib import Manager

            class MyClient(Manager):
                def on_start(self, *args):
                    raise NotImplementedError()

                def on_finish(self, *args):
                    raise NotImplementedError()

                def convert_to_petition(self, *args):
                    raise NotImplementedError()

    Once finished, both clients and servers must call :func:`shutdown` for finishing any
    pending petition before quitting. If not called, some garbage can left and your code
    will be prone to memory leaks.

    .. versionadded:: 0.1.7
        Processor now supports an attribute :attr:`look_ahead <orcha.lib.Processor.look_ahead>`
        which allows defining an amount of items that will be pop-ed from the queue,
        modifying the default behavior of just obtaining a single item. Setting the
        :class:`Manager`'s ``look_ahead`` will set :class:`Processor`'s ``look_ahead`` too.

    .. versionadded:: 0.1.9
        Processor supports a new attribute
        :attr:`notify_watchdog <orcha.lib.Processor.notify_watchdog>`
        that defines if the processor shall create a background thread that takes care of
        notifying systemd about our status and, if dead, to restart us.
        Setting the :class:`Manager`'s ``notify_watchdog`` will set
        :class:`Processor`'s ``notify_watchdog`` too.

    Args:
        listen_address (str, optional): address used when declaring a
                                        :class:`Manager <multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager>`
                                        object. Defaults to
                                        :attr:`listen_address <orcha.properties.listen_address>`.
        port (int, optional): port used when declaring a
                              :class:`Manager <multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager>`
                              object. Defaults to
                              :attr:`port <orcha.properties.port>`.
        auth_key (bytes, optional): authentication key used when declaring a
                                    :class:`Manager <multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager>`
                                    object. Defaults to
                                    :attr:`authkey <orcha.properties.authkey>`.
        create_processor (bool, optional): whether to create a :class:`Processor` object or not.
                                           The decision depends also on the :attr:`is_client`, as
                                           clients don't have any processor attached.
                                           Defaults to :obj:`True`.
        queue (Queue, optional): optional queue used when receiving petitions from clients.
                                 If not given, uses its own one. Defaults to :obj:`None`.
        finish_queue (Queue, optional): optional queue used when receiving signals from clients.
                                        If not given, uses its own one. Defaults to :obj:`None`.
        is_client (bool, optional): whether if the current manager behaves like a client or not,
                                    defining different actions on function calls.
                                    Defaults to :obj:`False`.
        look_ahead (:obj:`int`, optional): amount of items to look ahead when querying the queue.
            Having a value higher than 1 allows the processor to access items further in the queue
            if, for any reason, the next one is not available yet to be executed but the second
            one is (i.e.: if you define priorities based on time, allow the second item to be
            executed before the first one). Take special care with this parameter as this may
            cause starvation in processes.

    Simple :class:`Manager` that is intended to be used by clients, defining the expected common
    behavior of this kind of managers.

    By default, it only takes the three main arguments: ``listen_address``, ``port`` and
    ``auth_key``. The rest of the params are directly fulfilled and leveraged to the parent's
    constructor.

    In addition, the required abstract methods are directly overridden with no further action
    rather than throwing a :class:`NotImplementedError`.

    Note:
        This class defines no additional behavior rather than the basic one. Actually, it is
        exactly the same as implementing your own one as follows::

            from orcha.lib import Manager

            class ClientManager(Manager):
                def __init__(self):
                    super().__init__(is_client=True)

                def on_finish(self, *args):
                    pass

        The main point is that as all clients should have the behavior above a generic base
        class is given, so you can define as many clients as you want as simple as doing::

            from orcha.lib import ClientManager

            class MyClient(ClientManager): pass
            class MyOtherClient(ClientManager): pass
            ...
