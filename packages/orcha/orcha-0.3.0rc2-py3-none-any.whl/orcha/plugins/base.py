@dataclass(init=False)
class BasePlugin(ABC):
    """When developing your own application, the plugins must inherit from this class, as
    the basic expected structure is defined here.

    There are three exposed attributes:

        - :attr:`name`, which is the name of the command.
        - :attr:`aliases`, which are aliases for the command.
        - :attr:`help`, which is a help string for the command.

    In order to the plugin to work, you just need to inherit from this class
    and define all the required properties, such as :attr:`name`. Orcha by
    itself will find and load the plugin if everything is OK.

    Warning:
        In order the above method to work, you **must follow** an strict
        import order/path in your application. If you have a look at the
        :func:`main <orcha.bin.main>`,
        you will notice that two requirements must be fulfilled:

            1. Your plugin/module must be named as ``orcha_<YOUR_PLUGIN>`` so Orcha can find it.
            2. Your plugin/module must export the plugin class directly with the name ``plugin``.
               You can do it by defining a variable with that name, an alias or something like
               that at your script file or at your ``__init__.py`` file. You will be able to check
               if it will work as in the following example::

                   orcha_plugin/
                   ├ __init__.py
                   └ myplugin.py

               ::

                   # myplugin.py
                   from orcha.plugins import BasePlugin

                   class MyPlugin(BasePlugin):
                       ...

               ::

                   # __init__.py
                   from .myplugin import MyPlugin as plugin

               >>> import orcha_plugin
               >>> orcha_plugin.plugin
               <class 'orcha_plugin.myplugin.MyPlugin'>

    Note:
        Keep your plugin as simple as possible, as any further operation will cause an overall
        load of the entire orchestrator and a delay in responses. That's why this class is kept
        frozen, which means that you won't be able to change any attribute once it is created
        by the orchestrator.

    Once Orcha finds your plugin, the following operations will be done:

        1. When the constructor is called, the method :func:`create_parser` will be called
           and you will be able to include your own commands, subcommands and arguments.

           You don't need to do any special for detecting whether you will be called or not,
           the class provides a method :func:`can_handle` which evaluates if the specified
           commands can be managed by us.

        2. Once all the arguments have been parsed by the main function, they will be placed
           in the :attr:`extras <orcha.properties.extras>` attribute with the form::

                "argument-name": value

           in case you may need an easier way to access those attributes without the need
           to hold the :class:`Namespace <argparse.Namespace>` reference.

        3. If the provided command is for you, the :func:`handle` method will be called
           and you may start your own execution. In case your plugin is for a server, we
           suggest you to use the :mod:`orcha.interfaces` module for defining
           the behavior of it.
