# TODO
- error handling (or prevention) for json decode errors (e.g. when trying to delete a template that's still referenced by another object)
- QoL: implement input validation / provide some guidance on how object-json-definitions need to look like
- QoL: implement filtering (e.g. 'list all hosts that use template <xyz>', 'list all services that have value "Linux" in vars.os', etc.)
