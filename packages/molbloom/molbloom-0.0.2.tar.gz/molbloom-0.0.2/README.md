Can I buy this molecule? Returns results in about 500 ns and consumes about 2 GB of memory.

```py

buy('CCCO')
# True
but('ONN1CCCC1')
# False
```

If `buy` returns `True` - it may be purchasable with estimated error rate of 000335. If it returns `False` - it is not purchasable. Reference is ZINC20 from October 2021. Add `canonicalize=True` if your SMILES are not canonicalized (requires installing rdkit)
