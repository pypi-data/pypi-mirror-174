    """
    Minimum Jump Cost (MJC) dissimiliarity measure.
    This function implements the MJC algorithm devised by Joan Serra and Josep Lluis Arcos (2012). The MJC dissimilarity
    measure was shown to outperform the Dynamic Time Warp (DTW) dissimilarity measure on several datasets.

    mjc() takes two time series 's1' and 's2' and computes the minimum jump cost 'd_xy' between them. This is the
    dissimilarity measure.
    It has been modified so that it can compute the MJC of time series that have arbitrarily spaced data points,
    different sampling rates, and non-overlapping regions.

    An early abandoning variable, 'dxy_limit', allows you to specify a maximum dissimilarity that will cancel the
    computation.

    The time series are specified as follows:
        - They may be python Lists or numpy.ndarrays
        - They may be of different length.
        - They may or may not have time information.
        - If one of the time series has time information, the other must also have it.
        - Their datatype may be floats or integers.


    A time series with no time information is just an array of values. The first element of the array corresponds to
    the earliest point in the time series. Example: s1 = [d_0, d_1, d_2, ...], where d_i is the i-th value of the time
    series.
    A time series with time information must be a 2D array of shape (2, n). The data at index 0 are time
    data, and the data at index 1 is amplitude data.
    Example: s1 = [[t_0, t_1, t_2, ...], [d_0, d_1, d_2, ...]], where d_i is the i-th value of the time series, and t_i
    is the time of the i-th measurement. The time values may be integers or floats, and need not begin at 0.

    To visualize the algorithm, you may pass the variable show_plot=True. This will generate a plot with the two time
    series, and arrows signifying the jumps that the algorithm made when calculating the Minimum Jump Cost.

    ---- PERFORMANCE ----
    The time series are cast to numpy arrays. The checking and casting lowers execution speed. Therefore, an option to
    disable this checking and casting has been implemented. If you are certain that the time series s1 and s2
    are numpy.ndarray's of the format [[time data],[amplitude data]], you may pass the variable override_checks=True.

    The algorithm locates the overlapping region between the two timeseries. This step is skipped if the first and last
    timestamps are equal between the two timeseries. If your data has no time data, it is skipped if there is the same
    number of samples in each timeseries.

    As part of the calculation of the MJC, the algorithm calculates the standard deviations of the amplitude data, and
    the average sampling periods of s1 and s2. This lowers execution speed, but is required.
    However, if you know the standard deviations and/or the average time difference between data points of either
    (or both) s1 and s2 a-priori, you may pass these as variables. They are named std_s1, std_s2, tavg_s1, and
    tavg_s2. Any number of these may be passed. The ones which are not passed will be calculated.

        more information. If your data does not have time information, this value can be set to 1.

        more information. If your data does not have time information, this value can be set to 1.
