![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/studatio)

studatio is a Python tool for private music teachers to manage their studio's data.

I am primarily developing this for my own use as a violin teacher. However, I hope for the project to become useful to
other teachers. Currently, studatio is meant to pull iCal data about music lessons and format in a way that can be
useful for lesson schedules or facility reservations. I want to add support for automated facility reservations,
billing, and note-taking.

## Installation

First, install Python if it is not already installed. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install studatio.

```bash
pip install studatio
```

On first use, studatio will prompt you for a URL containing iCal data of your studio's calendar.

## Usage

```studatio``` prints and copies to clipboard a formatted list of studio events.

## Contributing

To build, you must install poetry and pre-commit. Pull requests are welcome.

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change or add. Documentation and test
coverage additions are just as welcome as changes to source code. I am an amateur programmer, but I always want to
learn, so if there are things that work but are not best practices, I would be eager to hear them.
