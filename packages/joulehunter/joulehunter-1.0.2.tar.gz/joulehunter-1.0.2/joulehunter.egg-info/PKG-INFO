        Joulehunter helps you find what part of your code is consuming considerable amounts of energy.
        
        This repo is still a work in progress. ðŸ˜„
        
        Compatibility
        ------------
        
        Joulehunter runs on **Linux** machines with **Intel RAPL** support. This technology has been available since the Sandy Bridge generation.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install joulehunter with pip: ```pip install joulehunter```.
        
        You can also clone the repo and install it directly:
        
             git clone https://github.com/powerapi-ng/joulehunter.git
             cd joulehunter
             python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        ------------
        
        Joulehunter works similarly to [pyinstrument](https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument), as we forked the repo and replaced time measuring with energy measuring. Here's [pyinstrument's documentation](https://pyinstrument.readthedocs.io/). Whenever ```pyinstrument``` is present in a variable name, it should be replaced with ```joulehunter``` (for example, ```PYINSTRUMENT_PROFILE_DIR``` turns into ```JOULEHUNTER_PROFILE_DIR```).
        
        ### Command line
        
        ```joulehunter -l``` will list the available domains on this machine. These include the packages and their components, such as the DRAM and core.
        
        The command ```joulehunter main.py``` will execute ```main.py``` and measure the energy consumption of the first package (CPU).
        
        To select the package to analyze use the option ```-p``` or ```--package``` followed by the package number or the package name. The default value is 0.
        
        The options ```-c``` and ```--component``` allow you to measure the energy of an individual component by specifying their name or ID. If not specified, the entire package will be selected.
        
        
        #### Example
        
        Executing ```joulehunter -l``` could output this:
            
            [0] package-0
              [0] core
              [1] uncore
              [2] dram
            [1] package-1
              [0] core
              [1] uncore
              [2] dram
        
        If we run ```joulehunter -p package-1 -c 2 my_file.py```, joulehunter will execute ```my_file.py``` and measure the energy consumption of package-1's DRAM.
        
        ### Profiling chunks of code
        
        As [pyinstrument's documentation](https://pyinstrument.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#profile-a-specific-chunk-of-code) shows, it's also possible to profile specific chunks of code.
        
        Joulehunter's Profiler class can receive two additional arguments: ```package``` and ```component```. They receive the ID (as a string or integer) or name of the desired package/component. If ```package``` is not specified, ```package-0``` will be used. If ```component``` is ```None```, the entire package will be analyzed.
        
        ### Profiling web requests in Flask
        
        Please refer to [pyinstrument's documentation](https://pyinstrument.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#profile-a-web-request-in-flask) for instructions on how to profile web requests in Flask. As in the previous case, joulehunter's ```Profiler()``` accepts two additional arguments.
        
        ### Profiling web requests in Django
        
        Profiling web requests in Django as explained in [pyinstrument's documentation](https://pyinstrument.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#profile-a-web-request-in-django) selects package 0 as the default domain (don't forget to rename the ```pyinstrument``` in variable names with ```joulehunter```).
        
        The user can choose a particular package and component as follows:
        
        **Query component**: The query strings ```package``` and ```component``` are used to select the desired package and component. For example, including ```?profiler&package=0&component=dram``` at the end of a request URL will select the first package and the DRAM. If the component query component is present but empty, the package will be analyzed.
        
        
        **Variable in ```settings.py```:** The user's selection can also be defined in ```settings.py``` with the ```JOULEHUNTER_PACKAGE``` and ```JOULEHUNTER_COMPONENT``` variables. These are later passed to ```Package()```.
        
        If the package or component is defined both as a query component and in ```settings.py```, the one defined as a query component will be selected.
        
        
        Read permission
        ---------------
        
        Due to a [security vulnerability](https://platypusattack.com), only root has read permission for the energy files. In order to circumvent this, run the script as root or grant read permissions for the following files:
        
            /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/intel-rapl/intel-rapl:*/energy_uj
            /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/intel-rapl/intel-rapl:*/intel-rapl:*:*/energy_uj
