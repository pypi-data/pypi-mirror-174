    The overcloud-hardened-uefi-full image now has a separate partition mounted
    to /boot. This means grub no longer needs to mount the root partition. This
    will allow trying layouts which grub doesn't support, such as LVM
    thin-provisioning. Since grub now uses the common path of loading an ext4
    /boot partition, early boot may now be more robust, or have better error
    messages for incorrectly built images.
