    The seven LVM volumes in the overcloud-hardened-uefi-full image are now
    thinly provisioned, backed by a single pool. The initial boot growvols
    behaviour is now to grow the pool to the size of the disk and grow each
    thin provisioned volume so the capacity of the pool is filled but not over
    provisioned. This will allow temporary volumes to be created for backups
    during upgrades, and it will allow the operator to over-provision a volume
    which requires extra capacity.
