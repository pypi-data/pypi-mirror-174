This is python package that offer state machine solution by class decorator.

# install

```shell
pip3 install statemachine-decorator
```

# example

```python
from statemachine_decorator import statemachine


@statemachine.stateDefine({
    "solid": {"gas", "fuild"},
    "fuild": {'solid', "gas"},
    "gas": {"solid", "fuild", "ionization"},
    "ionization": {"gas"}
})
class matter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.switch("solid")


mat = matter()
print(mat.state)
```

```python

    # Every state is a string, the state node is s subclass of str
    # A stateful class could be created like this:
    @stateDefine({
        "state1": set(),  # refers to no entry, means no state can switch "state1",
        "state2": {"state1", "state3"},

        "state3": {"state2", "state3"},  # refers to two entry, one is the state itself
        # it will raises an error if any string in args[0].values() (refers to above three python sets) is not exsits in the args[0].keys()(refers to the three string)
        # it will alse raise an error if you pass a non-str state key to the dict

## New in 1.2.5

NS as a new special value of the none state is added! You can pass None or NS to the first parameter to use it!

The NS state is a special state, which represent that the object has no current state, which is also a special state.
