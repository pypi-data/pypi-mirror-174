# Version pins, for use as a constraints file.

# docutils has been going through some turmoil.  Different packages require it,
# but have different pins.  This seems to satisfy them all:
#docutils>=0.17,<0.18

# https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/1617
pip<22.1

# requests gets different versions in dev.pip and doc/requirements.pip, not
# sure why, and they then ask for different versions of certifi, and we can't
# install, so pin certifi.
certifi==2022.5.18.1
