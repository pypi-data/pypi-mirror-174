This is the package for Pyston "lite",  the JIT part of [Pyston](https://github.com/pyston/pyston),
a faster implementation of Python. Pyston lite does not contain all of the
optimizations of full Pyston, but it is still 10-25% faster on many workloads.

Pyston lite is currently only available for Python 3.7-3.10
