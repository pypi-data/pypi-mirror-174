GTax
====

**GTax** python package provides tools for the creation of the GTax sequence-based database. This database includes
one assembly per organism deposited in the NCBI Genomes database. The sequences are organized by 19 taxonomic levels
from *superkindom* to *clades*. Python pickle files are also provided with a graph data structure for the taxonomic 
tree.

Current version
---------------

The current public version is available in GCP for download. You need to use your GCP project as this bucket uses 
**Requester Pays** option.

```
gsutil -u <you-GCP-project> -m cp -r gs://gtax-database/20211025 .
```
    
The database is comprised of two folder: **blastdb** and **fasta**. The **blastdb** folder include the BLAST 
indexes for BLAST searches. The **fasta** folder includes the FASTA files for the taxonomy groups and two 
Python Objects in pickle files (**taxonomy.pickle** and **taxonomy_groups.pickle**) which are used to load
all GTax metadata into the [Taxonomy class](https://github.com/ncbi/gtax/blob/main/src/gtax/taxonomy.py#L37)

```python
from gtax.taxonomy import Taxonomy
taxonomy = Taxonomy(tax_pickle_file='taxonomy.pickle', group_pickle_file = 'taxonomy_groups.pickle')
```
Output:
