## Typing stubs for emoji

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `emoji` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `emoji`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/emoji. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `emoji` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 2.2.0. Please uninstall the `types-emoji`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `7f476e1ddb8511dd38d9370500c1659aab6dc5f9`.
