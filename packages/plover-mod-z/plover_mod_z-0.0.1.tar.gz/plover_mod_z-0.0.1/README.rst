Plover Mod-Z
==========================

This plugin for plover provides the *Plover Mod-Z* system which is a minor modification of the standard English steno layout.
The only change is that the top S- is replaced with Z-.

The motivation was to bring the English layout closer to the German Regenpfeifer layout.

Since Z- is not present in the usual English layout, there are no conflicts with existing English dictionaries.
