# OccuPy
A fast and simple python module and program to estimate local scaling of cryo-EM maps, to approximate relative
occupancy and/or resolution, and optionally also equalise the map according to occupancy while suppressing solvent 
amplification.

Further documentation, instructions, and tutorials are available here.
