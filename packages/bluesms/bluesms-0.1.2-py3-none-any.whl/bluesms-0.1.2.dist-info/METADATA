# BlueSMS SDK
This is a python SDK for the BlueSMS API. It can be added to your current python-based application so as to interact with the BlueSMS Uganda API in a much simpler way.

## Why we created the BlueSMS SDK
We began using BlueSMS in many of our applications and were simply tired of writing code to send SMSes in every Python project we created. So we decided to create a python package that would make it easier for us to send SMSes in our projects. 

## Installation
```
pip install bluesms
``` 

## Usage
```
TBD
```
## Development Setup

Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/mwanjajoel/bluesms.git
```

We use Pipenv to manage our dependencies. To install pipenv, run the following command:
```
pip install pipenv
```

Activate the virtual environment by running the following command in your terminal:
```
pipenv shell
```

Install the dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
```
pipenv install
```

## Run tests
