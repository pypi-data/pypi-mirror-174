
~~WORK TO DO~~

Notes:

You should now populate your master file /home/daveg/Code/gssnng/docs/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Functions

    Variance of gene set. Rather than expression levels.

Speedups - Look into adding:

    Dask: https://dask.org/

    Numba: https://numba.pydata.org/
