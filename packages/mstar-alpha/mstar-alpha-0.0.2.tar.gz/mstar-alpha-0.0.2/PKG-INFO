Mstar: ML Stellar Mass Estimator
=======================================

Mstar is a fast and precise stellar mass estimator for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) galaxies. 
The algorithm consists of a machine learning code based on the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) architecture. Checkout our [github repo](https://github.com/estevesjh/mstar-alpha).

The estimator was trained on the DES deep fields matched with the COSMOS dataset.
Our results were cross validated with a local volume sample, the SDSS sample matched with DES.
For more information about the validation process take a look at [Esteves et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/)

## How to use 

The input information is simply the galaxy redshift colors and the z-band magnitude.

.. posterior probability distributions of galaxy properties (e.g. redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate,
.. metallicity). Documentation for the package is available at `galpro.readthedocs.io <https://galpro.readthedocs.io/>`_.

.. Galpro is hosted on PyPI and can be installed using::
