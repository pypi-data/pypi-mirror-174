function  [quat2_corr, delta, delta_filt, rating, state_out, debug_data] = headingCorrection(gyr1, gyr2, quat1, quat2, t, joint, jointInfo, estSettings, debug)
    % This function corrects the heading of a kinematic chain of two segments whose orientations are estimated without
    % the use of magnetometers. It corrects the heading of the second segment in a way that its orientation is estimated
    % in the reference of the first segment. It uses kinematic constraints for rotational joints to estimate the heading
    % offset of both segments based on the limited set of possible relative orientations induced by the rotational
    % joint. There are methods for 1D, 2D and 3D joints, based on different constraints.
    %
    % Equivalent Python function: :func:`qmt.headingCorrection`.

    %                 e.g. 'xyz'

    %               - estimation_rate: rate in Hz at which the estimation should be performed. typically below 1Hz is sufficient
    %               - data_rate: rate at which new data is fed into the estimation. Is used to downsample the data for a faster estimation. Typically values around 5Hz are sufficient
    %               - alignment: String of the chosen type of alignment of the estimation window. It describes how the samples around the  current sample at which the estimation takes place are chosen. Possible values: 'backward', 'center', 'forward'
